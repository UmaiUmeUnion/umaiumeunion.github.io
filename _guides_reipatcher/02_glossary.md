# Glossary of the guide

Here is a table of important terms used throughout of this guide.

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| **mod** | Modification to the game's behaviour. Consists of different modules (DLLs) for ReiPatcher, UnityInjector or other tools alike.<br/> *Note:* On forums and other websites mods are usually referred to as plugins or patchers, while the word "mod" is reserved to mean a modification to the game's assets. In this tutorial, however, a plugin has a slightly different meaning, which is why the word "mod" is used instead. |
| **patcher** | An assembly (or a module, in general) that consists of at least one class the purpose of which is to change the contents of some game assembly. |
| **plugin** | An assembly that contains at least one `MonoBehaviour` that is loaded into the game using UnityInjector. |
